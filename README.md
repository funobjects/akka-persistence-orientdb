# akka-persistence-orientdb
Experimental Akka Persistence storage plugin for OrientDB.

This plugin allows an embedded OrientDB instance to be used
as a local Akka Persistence journal.  The plugin passes the
TCK in Akka 2.3.9,  but the code is brand-new and should be
considered highly experimental at this stage.

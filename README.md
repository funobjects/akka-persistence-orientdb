# akka-persistence-orientdb
Experimental Akka Persistence storage plugin for OrientDB.

This plugin allows an embedded OrientDB instance to be used
as a local Akka Persistence journal or snapshot store.  The
plugin passes the TCK in Akka 2.4.8, but the code is brand
new and should be considered highly experimental at this stage.
